## What is the witnessTree project?

The witnessTree project is an open-source project that enables trees fitted with a simple monitoring system to automatically post messages, figures and images about the functioning of the tree and its environment on social media in near-real-time. Currently, the implementation focusses on twitter as a platform, but expansion to instagram, snap chat and facebook are explored. 

# What is a witnessTree?

A witness tree is a tree that describes its life as apart of the natural environment commenting on climatic, ecological, and physiological events. The tree is enabled to speak for itself, using sensors and software that translates data into easily interpretable messages for the general public.

# What is the aim of the witnessTree project?

The aim is to provide an untainted voice about climate and how it is experienced by the dominant form of life on earth, trees. The messages and figures are descriptive in nature, such as comparison between current and previous states. Overall, the witnessTree is a means to reach out, inform and educate the general public about what is happening in the forests around them.

# Who is the team behind the witnessTree?

Tim Rademacher is the project lead. Kyle Wyche is developing the first implementation. David Basler has contributed to the project with ideas and code. Tim developed the idea based on the twittering trees from Europe and the book "Witness Tree: Seasons of Change with a Century-Old Oak" by Lynda V. Mapes.

## How does it work?

The project is divided into several hardware and software components that are undergoing active development and can easily be customised. Overall, necessities for a witness tree are sensors on a tree, which transfer acquired data to the server that hosts the softwware, which is publicly available in this github repository.

The repository and code are organised following a specific folder structure. There is a data/ folder containing the raw data. R scripts, which analyse the data and create messages, are stored in the RScripts/ folder. The R scripts are divided into various functions that can be linked in the main script called witnessTree.R. The R functions also generate figures and store them as png-files in the figures/ folder. Additionally, stock photos stored in the images/ folder are used with certain recurring messages.

In a second step the generated figures and messages are passed to twitter by python scripts, which are stored in the pythonScript/ folder. The python and R scripts are run at regular intervals to generate and post messages. 

Finally, a tmp/ folder exists for temporary storage of file, results, logs, etc.
